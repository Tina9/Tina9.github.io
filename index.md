I am Xu Zhang, a CS student at the University of Hong Kong. My supervisors are [Professor Hing-Fung Ting](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/hfting) and [Professor Tak-Wah Lam](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/twlam).

Prior to that, I was very lucky to work with [Professor Chu-Xia Deng](https://fhs.um.edu.mo/en/staff/chuxia-deng/) at University of Macau as a research assistant on Cancer Informatics.

I received B.S. in Biology Science from Shanxi Agricultural University.

My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Multi-omics, Cancer Bioinformatics, and Single Cell Sequencing.
